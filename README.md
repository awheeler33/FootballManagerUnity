# FootballManagerUnity
Considering Football Manager 2025 is delayed until March, rather than dive into yet another save where I take Quilmes Atletic Club to the Copa Libertadores final and lose for the 4th time running I figured it would be a cool project to at least try and recreate some of the logic and test my skills in making a simulation management game
